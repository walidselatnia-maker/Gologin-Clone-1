# What we found in D:\Downloads\gologin_.exe

gologin_.exe is a program for Windows, built for x86 (32-bit). It appears to be packed or protected (NSIS installer), so most of its real code is hidden until it runs. Its internal names were removed (stripped), so most functions will have generated names.
